# Building a Chatbot using Python

Problem Statement:

A Chat-bot is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, instead of providing direct contact with a live human agent. Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner. In the proposed system, we presented a chatbot that generates a dynamic response for online client's queries. The web-based platform provides a vast intelligent base that can help simulate problem- solving for humans. This proposed chatbot identifies the user context which triggers the particular intent for a response. Since it is responding dynamic response, the desired answer will be generated for the user.

# What is a Chatbot:

• A chatbot is a computer program that can talk to humans in natural language.

• With chatbots, people can have a conversation or interact with a software program that helps them find answers quickly.

• The simplest form of a chatbot system parses customer input, then scans its database for articles related to certain words and phrases.

• The computer program behind the chatbot sticks to a strict set of predefined rules given by the developer.

# Public / Business Needs:

Weather Forecast: The goal of weather prediction is to provide information people and organizations can use to reduce weather-related losses and enhance societal benefits, including protection of life and property, public health and safety, and support of economic prosperity and quality of life.

BBC News: News is important for a number of reasons within a society. Mainly to inform the public about events that are around them and may affect them. News from one country to another is important in today’s global economy. Knowing what is happening in other countries gives people a perspective of each other’s ways of life and cultural differences. Certain kinds of news from countries that rely on each other for energy or other resources can often have a profound influence in overall global economics.

National Stock Exchange (NSE): The stock market is considered as a network of stock exchanges where traders and investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. The stock market serves two important purposes. First, it helps companies raise money often referred to as capital from the public by offering shares for sale, which can be used to fund and expand their business. Secondly, it gives an investor, who purchases those shares, an opportunity to have a share in the company’s profits.
